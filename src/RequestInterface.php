/**
 * Representation of an outgoing, client-side request.
 * 本接口代表用户端的请求
 *
 * Per the HTTP specification, this interface includes properties for
 * each of the following:
 * 每个HTTP协议，本接口都包含以下属性：
 *
 * - Protocol version 协议版本
 * - HTTP method 请求方法
 * - URI URI
 * - Headers 请求头
 * - Message body 请求体
 *
 * During construction, implementations MUST attempt to set the Host header from
 * a provided URI if no Host header is provided.
 * 在构建过程中，假如未设置Host请求头，实现类 必须（MUST） 根据提供的URI尝试设置Host请求头
 *
 * Requests are considered immutable; all methods that might change state MUST
 * be implemented such that they retain the internal state of the current
 * message and return an instance that contains the changed state.
 * 在此，我们认为HTTP请求是不可变的。所有可能会改变消息状态的方法 必须（MUST） 被实现，
 * 以便保持当前HTTP消息的内部状态，并返回一个实例包含已改变的状态。
